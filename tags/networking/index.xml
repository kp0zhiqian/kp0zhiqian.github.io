      <description>This is the transcript of my XDP 5 mins tech talk in QE all hands. Only for sharing and archiving.
 XDP is a technology that can achieve high-speed networking performance. Allowing packets to be reflected, filtered, or redirected, but without traversing kernel networking stack.
After hearing this, some may think: Oh, Iâ€™ve heard of this! Like the famous DPDK, I can bypass the Kernel and do whatever I want in userspace to the incoming packets.</description>

      <description>In the first article of this series of articles, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the concepts we need to implement to design a very basic reliable transport protocol. How to implement these concepts will be covered in future articles.
If you found anything incorrect, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to reach me.
Checksum Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re designing a reliable transport protocol. You&amp;rsquo;ve already implemented the basic send and receive features, including segmenting the whole data when it&amp;rsquo;s too large.</description>
