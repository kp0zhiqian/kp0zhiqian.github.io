      <description>This is the transcript of my XDP 5 mins tech talk in QE all hands. Only for sharing and archiving.
 XDP is a technology that can achieve high-speed networking performance. Allowing packets to be reflected, filtered, or redirected, but without traversing kernel networking stack.
After hearing this, some may think: Oh, Iâ€™ve heard of this! Like the famous DPDK, I can bypass the Kernel and do whatever I want in userspace to the incoming packets.</description>
